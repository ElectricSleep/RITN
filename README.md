# RITN
An attempt at a Cross Platform native application that captures sheet music and then transcribes it into guitar chords.

## How it's made:

1. Input: Upload file
2. Processing: Process notation, extract notes, infer chords
3. Output: Display guitar chords

**Tech used:**

- Flutter (Dart)
- Rust

I don't have an experience with either Flutter or Rust, though I've come across both; I'd like to try and build something and see how functional I may get it.
